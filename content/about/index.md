Ethos Drama is an English theatre organization based in Warsaw, Poland. Ethos Drama was founded by one person, Zachary Herman, an American English Studies student at SWPS. He found that Warsaw and Poland as a whole, lacked places for non-Polish speakers or English enthusiasts to interact and involve themselves in the arts, specifically theatre.

So in hopes to provide Poland with a home and community for English speakers, Ethos Drama came to be. Members come from all over the world from countries such as The United States, Turkey, Hong Kong, Italy, Ukraine, Norway and Poland. All plays are acted, directed, staged and written by our members. All are welcome here as long as they have a passion for theatre, speak English and have just a slight god-complex.
