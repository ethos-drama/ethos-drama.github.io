My name is Zachary Herman, I was raised in Virginia by a metal worker and the daughter of a Pentecostal preacher. I am a third-year English philology student and the head of the ETO. I am interested in theatre, theology, philosophy, and literature; particularly the works of Kierkegaard, Houellebecq, Yukio Mishima, and C.S. Lewis.
