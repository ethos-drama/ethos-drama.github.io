Well I’m English Philology student at SWPS, I really enjoy theatre. When I was little kid I liked dressing up, reciting poems and performing. Besides theatre I simply like art and I paint something from time to time (on canvas or on a piece of cardboard). Being a part of ETO is a wonderland journey.
