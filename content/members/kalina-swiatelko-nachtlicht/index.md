Hi! My name is Kalina and I'm a student of Communication Design at SoF. I was born and raised in Warsaw, the best city in the world. I love dystopian books, collaging and most of all starting art projects and not finishing them. My biggest inspirations at the moment include Alex Khabbazi, Enikő Katalin Eged, Dominic Dähncke and many more.
