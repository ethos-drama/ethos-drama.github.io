Pain. He moves to the left, he groans. He moves to the right, the coughing comes harsher. He can only lie back and there, there is only dull, enduring pain. He waits for his children, for his doctor, for his salvation. Will they understand? Will his daughters learn their place? Will his son stop being a waste? He does not know. But he will wait on and on and on and on and… What’s that tapping coming from the hall?
